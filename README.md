## 📂 Project Overview

This is my first portfolio website, built from scratch using:

- ✅ **HTML** – for semantic structure  
- ✅ **CSS** – for responsive, modern styling  
- ✅ **JavaScript (minimal)** – logic and interactivity  
- ✅ **Git + Bash** – for version control and deployment

It includes custom sections for:

- **Hero Header** with my role and skills  
- **About Me** with a clean bio section  
- **Projects** with card-style layouts  
- **Contact** with clickable links to email, GitHub, and LinkedIn

## 💡 What I Learned

This wasn't just about writing code — it was about becoming a developer:

- How to **use the terminal** and navigate GitHub  
- How to **fix broken sections** and line up layout elements manually  
- How to **structure HTML and CSS properly** so nothing breaks  
- How to **teach AI how to help me**, while also learning how to debug its output  
- How to create a fully deployable site using **GitHub Pages**

> “I’m teaching the code — and the code is teaching me.”
